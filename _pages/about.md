My name is Mark Mwaura.I'm born and raised in Nairobi Kenya.I love working with technology especially using it to solve challenges communities in kenya and around the world face.Technology helps me find, analyze existing challenges and develop solutions around these challenges to make the world a better place.

I'm currently at Moringa School where i'm learning and perfecting my skill in programming.It is an exciting journey and a wonderful opportunity.I particularly  like to code for Mobile(Android Java) and python.Other competencies include php(Laravel), html and css.

I also like to listen to music anytime :-)
