### An Overview of Responsive Web Design


The growth of the internet has led to numerous devices that can access the web.These days its difficult to find someone who doesn't own a mobile device , or multiple connected to the internet.

Due to this growth, the question about how to create websites suitable for all users is crucial .This leads to the answer to the question, which is RWD(Responsive Web Design).

In short responsive web design deals with how to show a website on a mobile device in the most usable and user-friendly manner without major distortions of the content/message shown.

### Responsive Vs Adaptive Vs Mobile

These terms may have been used by many interchangeably though they all have different meanings

### Responsive 

Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related, and often transposed as one in the same. Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change, while adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change. With responsive design websites continually and fluidly change based on different factors, such as viewport width, while adaptive websites are built to a groups of preset factors. A combination of the two is ideal, providing the perfect formula for functional websites. Which term is used specifically doesn’t make a huge difference.

### Mobile

Mobile, on the other hand, generally means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users. While this does occasionally have it’s place, it normally isn’t a great idea. Mobile websites can be extremely light but they do come with the dependencies of a new code base and browser sniffing, all of which can become an obstacle for both developers and users.


Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media. 

#### Flexible Layouts

This refers to a better usable layout/structure for the website on the mobile device.

#### Media Queries

This is are special tags provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example.

#### Flexible Media

The final, equally important aspect to responsive web design involves flexible media. As viewports begin to change size media doesn’t always follow suit. Images, videos, and other media types need to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes.

One quick way to make media scalable is by using the max-width property with a value of 100%. Doing so ensures that as the viewport gets smaller any media will scale down according to its containers width.
