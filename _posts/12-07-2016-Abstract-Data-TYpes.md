### Abstract Data types

An abstract data is a model of a certain kind of structure e.g.a Stack, queue. A Stack has push() and pop() operations and that have well-defined behaviour.The abstract data type  can be implemented in any programming language both object and functional programming languages.

### Stacks

![Stack](http://markmwaura.github.io/images/stack.png)

Latest elements added to the list will always be removed first.New items will be added(pushed) and removed(popped)
from the list, following a Last in First Out(LIFO) data structure.

### Queue

![Queue](http://markmwaura.github.io/images/queue.png)

Queues follow a first in first out data structure.for example a line of people at a bus stop,doctors medical check or a supermarket waiting to checkin/ check items out.


### Linked List

A linked list refers to  group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Each node is composed of a data and a reference(link)/ pointer, to the next node in the sequence.
