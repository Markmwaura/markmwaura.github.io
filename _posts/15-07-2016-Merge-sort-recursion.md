### Merge-sort algorithm (Divide and Conquer)

![Merge-Sort](http://markmwaura.github.io/images/Merge_sort_algorithm.png)

Merge-sort algorithm works in a very simple manner.The algorithm first splits the array into its simplest form of singular values.
After splitting the values to each singular item, the algorithm sorts using a pair , if the elements are already sorted , they are joined to form a bigger array which is also sorted numerically on the pairs to form a more sorted array.

Merge-sort algorithm is also faster than bubble-sort
