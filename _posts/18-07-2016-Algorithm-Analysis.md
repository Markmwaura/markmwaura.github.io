### Algorithm Analysis

Algorithm analysis refers to the analysis of the process of achieving an output , checking whether the
algorithm is efficient or not.To evaluate efficiency time and space are taken into consideration.

**Categories of Algorithm Analysis**

        a) Time complexity

       1.Worst case complexity - runs for a long period of time
       2.Average case complexity - runs in medium time
       3.Best case complexity -runs at minimum time

      b)Space complexity

      These days space is insignificant, due to the availability of memory and memory devices.

**Asymptotic Analysis**

The approach used to calculate the complexity of an algorithm in its theoretical analysis.
**Asymptotic** - denotes a condition where a line tends to meet a curve, but they do not intersect  on a  graph.

**Asymptotic notations **

    1.Big Oh notation

    2.Omega

    3.Theta


====>Growth Rate of an Algorithm

====>Big O notation - complexity
