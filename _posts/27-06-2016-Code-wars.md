#Code Wars#
Code wars is an interesting place where you get to train by doing short quizes
in a particular language of choice.You can choose from java, javascript,python, ruby , just to name a few.Over the last one month i have managed to do several "Katas".It helps a lot in developing discipline for language
features that include loops,functions,math and more..Head over to [CodeWars.com](https://www.codewars.com), to begin.
