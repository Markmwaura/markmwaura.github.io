# Front-end Web Development

Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or web application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. There are so many tutorials and guides on how to be a front end developer but so far I have used ShayHowe’s Web Development. For Beginners it is a really good tutorial as it takes you through step by step. However, with every task comes challenges and Front end development is not shy of them. You can customize the look and feel of your website using CSS.


HTML pages are then styled and the text and images made more appealing using CSS - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) which is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.


To start learning Front end development you first must learn HTMl - HyperText Markup Language, commonly abbreviated as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML is a cornerstone technology used to create web pages, as well as to create user interfaces for mobile and web applications. Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically.


The two languages—HTML and CSS—are independent of one another and should remain that way. CSS should not be written inside of an HTML document and vice versa. As a rule, HTML will always represent content, and CSS will always represent the appearance of that content.
To be a great Front End Web Developer you must have masterly of both CSS and HTML you can build very powerful and nicely looking websites.
