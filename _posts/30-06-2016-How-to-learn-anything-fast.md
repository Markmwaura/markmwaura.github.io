# 1.Decide what you want

What is it going to look like when you’re done? The more clearly you define it, the easier it will be for you to accomplish that end result (Defining a target performance level).

# 2.Deconstruct what you want

Most skills are bundles of sub-skills that we use in combination. Practice the most important sub-skills.

# 3.Research

Just enough that you are able to identify the most important sub-skills (books, courses, dvds, trainers). Understand which of these will help you get as good as you can as quick as you can.

# 4.Removing barriers to practice

Remove the distractions that take your focus away from the thing you want to practice. Make it easy for yourself to practice.


# 5.Precommit to 20 hours of deliberate practice in a skill

The early hours of practice are frustrating. By committing to at least 20 hours of practice, you are guaranteeing yourself to make it through those hours.﻿
